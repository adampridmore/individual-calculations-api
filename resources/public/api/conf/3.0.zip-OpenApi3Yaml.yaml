  description: "This API allows a developer to:\n\n* trigger a customer’s self assessment tax calculation\n* list a customer’s self assessment tax calculations for a tax year\n* retrieve a customer’s self assessment tax calculation result\n* submit a self assessment final declaration for a tax year\n\nIn previous versions, the term ‘crystallise’ was used to mean submit a final declaration, and the term ‘intent to crystallise’ was used to mean trigger a final declaration self-assessment tax calculation.\n\nFor information on how to connect to this API [see the Income Tax MTD end-to-end service guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/).\nHMRC monitors transactions to help protect your customers' confidential data from criminals and fraudsters. \n\n<div class=\"govuk-warning-text warning-icon-fix\">\n  <span class=\"govuk-warning-text__icon warning-icon-ui-fix\" aria-hidden=\"true\">!</span>\n  <strong class=\"govuk-warning-text__text\">\n    <span class=\"govuk-warning-text__assistive\">Warning</span>\n    You are required by law to submit header data for this API. This includes all associated APIs and endpoints.\n  </strong>\n</div>\n\n[Check the data you need to send](/guides/fraud-prevention/). You can also use the [Test API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/txm-fph-validator-api/1.0) during initial development and as part of your quality assurance checks.\nWhen an API changes in a way that is backwards-incompatible, we increase the version number of the API. \nSee our [reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#versioning) for more on\nversioning.\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n- 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action\n- 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application\n- 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server\n\nErrors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#errors) for more on errors.\n\nSingle errors will be returned in the following format:<br>\n`{\n    \"code\": \"FORMAT_FIELD_NAME\",\n    \"message\": \"The provided FieldName is invalid\"\n}`\n\nWhere possible, multiple errors will be returned with `INVALID_REQUEST` in the following format:<br>\n`{\n    \"code\": \"INVALID_REQUEST\",\n    \"message\": \"Invalid request\",\n    \"errors\": [\n        {\n            \"code\": \"RULE_FIELD_NAME\",\n            \"message\": \"The provided FieldName is not allowed\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"code\": \"FORMAT_FIELD_NAME\",\n            \"message\": \"The provided FieldName is invalid\"\n        }\n    ]\n}`\nYou can find the changelog in the [income-tax-mtd-changelog](https://github.com/hmrc/income-tax-mtd-changelog/wiki) GitHub wiki.\n* Raise non-technical or platform-related issues with the [Software Development Support Team (SDST)](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/support).\n* Raise technical issues on the [income-tax-mtd-changelog](https://github.com/hmrc/income-tax-mtd-changelog/issues) GitHub page.\nYou can use the sandbox environment to <a href=\"/api-documentation/docs/testing\">test this API</a>. You can use the <a href=\"/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0\">Create Test User API</a> or it's frontend service to create test users.\n\nIt may not be possible to test all scenarios in the sandbox. You can test some scenarios by passing the Gov-Test-Scenario header. Documentation for each endpoint includes a **Test data** section, which explains the scenarios that you can simulate using the Gov-Test-Scenario header.\n\nIf you have a specific testing need that is not supported in the sandbox, contact <a href=\"/developer/support\">our support team</a>.\n\nSome APIs may be marked \\[test only\\]. This means that they are not available for use in production and may change."
